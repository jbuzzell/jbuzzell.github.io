            <h5>Cacophony</h5>
            <h6>Experimental Melody Generator</h6>
            <div>
                <i>Cacophony</i> is a currently-in-development guitar-to-MIDI module that detects (or perhaps suggests) 
                the key a musician is playing in, and sends randomly generated melodies in that key to two external MIDI
                devices in parallel. Melodies generated by <i>Cacophony</i> can be interacted with in a number of ways. For 
                instance, the user can adjust basic things like the melody's tempo or step length, or even lock a melody in
                place with a momentary footswitch. More complex adustments to the device's MIDI outputs can be made as well;
                for example, the user can select various MIDI output modes such as parallel, mutually exclusive, and latching.
                <i>Cacophony</i> is Jake's Senior Capstone project at Champlain College, and is slated to be completed by April 20th 2020.

                    As a Web Design Intern at Champlain College's Marketing, Jake aided with the creation of new page layouts and CMS components.
                A notable project he aided with was the redevelopment of a series of pages about life on Champlain's campus.
                In the weeks and months leading up to the project, he helped develop a number of new reusable page components
                for use in the site's <a href="https://www.champlain.edu/academics/academic-divisions/robert-p-stiller-school-of-business">Academic Division</a>
                pages. The development of these page components paved the way for the <a href="https://www.champlain.edu/student-life/residence-halls">Student Life</a>
                 pages, whose development time was largely focused on polish and content edits.

                    Sigiriya is a resource-management game with a heavy focus on narrative and the player's relationship with the game's 
                    characters. Jake wrote music and created foley sounds for tactile interations in the game. <a href="https://radmagpie.org/sigiriya">
